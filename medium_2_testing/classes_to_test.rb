Classes to Test - Cash Register and Transaction

These will be the classes you will be testing throughout the remaining exercises.
You'll want to create two new files, one for each of the two classes listed below.
You'll need this code for the remaining exercises of this set.

# cash_register.rb

class CashRegister
  attr_reader :total_money

  def initialize(total_money)
    @total_money = total_money
  end

  def change(transaction)
    transaction.amount_paid - transaction.item_cost
  end

  def give_receipt(transaction)
    puts "You've paid $#{transaction.item_cost}."
  end

  def accept_money(transaction)
    @total_money += transaction.amount_paid
  end

  def start_transaction(transaction)
    transaction.prompt_for_payment
    accept_money(transaction)
    change(transaction)
    give_receipt(transaction)
  end
end


# transaction.rb

class Transaction
  attr_reader :item_cost
  attr_accessor :amount_paid

  def initialize(item_cost)
    @item_cost = item_cost
    @amount_paid = 0
  end

  def prompt_for_payment
    loop do
      puts "You owe $#{item_cost}.\nHow much are you paying?"
      @amount_paid = gets.chomp.to_f
      break if valid_payment? && sufficient_payment?
      puts 'That is not the correct amount. ' \
           'Please make sure to pay the full cost.'
    end
  end

  private

  def valid_payment?
    amount_paid > 0.0
  end

  def sufficient_payment?
    amount_paid >= item_cost
  end
end
