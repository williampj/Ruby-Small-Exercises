Text Analyzer - Sandwich Code
Fill out the rest of the Ruby code below so that print output like that shown in "Sample Output."
You should read the text from a simple text file that you provide.
(We also supply some example text below, but try the program with your text as well.)

Read the text file in the #process method and pass the text to the block provided in each call.
Everything you need to work on is either part of the #process method or part of the blocks.
You need no other additions or changes.

The text you use does not have to produce the same numbers as the sample output but should have the indicated format.

Sample Text File:

Eiusmod non aute commodo excepteur amet consequat ex elit. Ut excepteur ipsum
enim nulla aliqua fugiat quis dolore do minim non. Ad ex elit nulla commodo
aliqua eiusmod aliqua duis officia excepteur eiusmod veniam. Enim culpa laborum
nisi magna esse nulla ipsum ex consequat. Et enim et quis excepteur tempor ea
sit consequat cupidatat.

Esse commodo magna dolore adipisicing Lorem veniam quis ut labore pariatur quis
aliquip labore ad. Voluptate ullamco aliquip cillum cupidatat id in sint ipsum
pariatur nisi adipisicing exercitation id adipisicing qui. Nulla proident ad
elit dolore exercitation cupidatat mollit consequat enim cupidatat tempor
aliqua ea sunt ex nisi non.

Officia dolore labore non labore irure nisi ad minim consectetur non irure
veniam dolor. Laboris cillum fugiat reprehenderit elit consequat ullamco veniam
commodo.

Sample Output:

3 paragraphs
15 lines
126 words

----------
Solution:

class TextAnalyzer
  def process
    text = File.open('text.txt', 'r')
    yield(text) # passes the whole file
    text.close
  end
end

analyzer = TextAnalyzer.new
analyzer.process { |text| puts "#{text.read.scan(/(\n\n)|(\z)/).size} paragraphs" }
analyzer.process { |text| puts "#{text.read.scan(/\n/).size} lines" }
analyzer.process { |text| puts "#{text.read.scan(/\b\w+?\b/).size} words" } #word boundary + word chars lazy + word boundary

------
LS Solution:

You may assume that paragraphs have one empty line between them and that each line ends with a newline character.
A single space appears between all words.

class TextAnalyzer
  def process
    file = File.open('sample_text.txt', 'r')
    yield(file.read) # passes the string
    file.close
  end
end

analyzer = TextAnalyzer.new
analyzer.process { |text| puts "#{text.split("\n\n").count} paragraphs" }
analyzer.process { |text| puts "#{text.split("\n").count} lines" }
analyzer.process { |text| puts "#{text.split(' ').count} words" }

Discussion
For this exercise, you must fill in the missing parts of the code we gave you.
You know the output we want; you must somehow produce that output.

Start with the #process method; we told you that #process should read some text from a file,
and then pass that text to the block for further processing.
The usual approach for such read-and-process code looks like this:

file = File.open('sample_text.txt', 'r')
# do processing here
file.close
Remember to always close files when you finish using them.

Since we're supposed to pass the text content of the file to the block, we must load the file's content and call the block,
which we do with yield(file.read):

file = File.open('sample_text.txt', 'r')
yield(file.read)
file.close

At this point we have what we call "sandwich code";
it performs some pre- and post-processing for some arbitrary action.
Here, the pre-processing opens a file, and the post-processing closes it.
Together, they sandwich the action that loads the file's contents and passes it to a block.

Since we're passing text to the blocks, the blocks should capture that text:

analyzer.process { |text| puts ... }
analyzer.process { |text| puts ... }
analyzer.process { |text| puts ... }
Judging from the partial code, you can see that each block contains a puts statement,
so we must provide arguments to puts that perform the necessary processing and format the answer accordingly.
The last step fills in these details: for each, we use String#split and Array#count as you can see in the Solution.

--------
Student solutions:

Explicit block cleans it up a bit and relies on the "sandwich code" within File.open implementation
(From LS Intro to Programming with Ruby book: Ruby will automagically close the file if the open method is called with a block.).
Note: default open mode is 'r':

# Ruby-docs: open(filename, mode="r" [, opt]) {|file| block } â†’ obj

class TextAnalyzer
  def process(&block)
    File.open('sample.txt', &block)
  end
end

analyzer = TextAnalyzer.new
analyzer.process { |f| puts "#{f.read.split(/\n{2}/).count} paragraphs" }
analyzer.process { |f| puts "#{f.read.split(/\n/).count} lines" }
analyzer.process { |f| puts "#{f.read.split.count} words" }
